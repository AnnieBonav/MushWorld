# MushWorld
Hey there! Mushworld is my playground and will have my final project for the Game Engine course I am taking at university.

## Modeling
I decided to model all of my assets, to put into practice **blender**. For that, I have created multiple nature low-poly models, as well as materials (directly in Unity).

## Shaders
As part of my personal exercises, I have cretaed different coded shaders that work on my URP. Here are some videos on how they look like!
